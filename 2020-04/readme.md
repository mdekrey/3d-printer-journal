So, despite a blank journal, I didn't completely take the month off, I just didn't print much due to COVID-19.

I added a glass bed to my supplies, as well as a 0.2mm and a 0.6mm nozzle. Unfortunately, I barely learned how to use the glass bed, and did not try the nozzles.

The glass bed I was able to print a couple blue PLA [articulated lizards](../2020-02/08/03-articulated-lizard.md), but needed a heavy coat of glue stick to get them to adhere at all. One was given to my mom, another to a friend's son. I printed this with the same file as before, so it was identical settings - same temperature and everything, which meant a 50C bed temperature. I think PLA needs it warmer.

Also, the mitre guide I made last month didn't print as well as I thought - it warped in the garage, and some of the layers frayed. It sounds like it needed a higher print temperature to adhere well, but also a hotter print surface may help it adhere better initially, and then let it cool on later layers so it doesn't curl. I plan on reprinting it with ABS, however.
