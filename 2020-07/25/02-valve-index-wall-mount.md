# Print

Model: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3723289

Slicer: Simplify3d

Filament: Hatchbox Black PLA

Settings:
- 0.2mm resolution
- Mostly default for Flashforge Creator Pro, using PLA, except:
    - 1.0 extrusion
    - Extruder heat at 200C
    - Bed heat at 60C
    - 100% for first layer, 4 top/bottom layers, 3 perimeter shells
    - 20% infill
    - Optimize perimeter start points
    - Skirt, no raft, no supports

# Results

In order to get successful results, I did the following process:

1. Cleaned the bed.
2. Dried with blow drier.
3. Applied fresh glue-stick to the print area bed
5. Replaced the glass
6. Tightened the thumb screws
7. Began the print.

Because it was PLA, I skipped preheating.

This turned out almost perfect, but because I skipped levelling, I noticed inconsistencies in how the first layer merged - on one side, the filament is relatively separated on the first layer (giving a rough texture) almost like when the raft was used, while on the other side it merged together and got glassy.
