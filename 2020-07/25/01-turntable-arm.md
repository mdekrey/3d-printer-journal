# Results

In order to get successful results, I did the following process:

1. Cleaned the bed.
2. Dried with blow drier.
3. Applied fresh glue-stick to the print area of the bed
5. Replaced the glass
6. Tightened the thumb screws
7. Began the print.

Because it was PLA, I skipped preheating. These still turned out great.
