Model: Giant Tree 1, 12cm from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2853566
    - scaled down to 35%, max triangle size at 0.1mm via Mesh -> Mesh Reduction

Slicer: Simplify3d

Filament: Black PLA from Hatchbox

Settings:
- 0.1mm resolution
- Mostly default for Flashforge Creator Pro, using PLA, except:
    - Extruder heat at 200C
    - Bed heat at 50C
    - 200% for first layer, 6 top/bottom layers, 2 perimeter shells
    - 20% infill
    - Random perimeter start points
    - No skirt, raft, no supports

# Notes

I scaled this down because a) 12cm is HUGE and b) I really want a quick test. 35% would fit the base in 1 inch, ideal for scatter terrain.

This puts it at 4.2cm tall, which I should continue to use for the other tree scatter terrain, when feasible.
