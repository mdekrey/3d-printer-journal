# Results

These mostly worked, but I quickly discovered that both the base and the top weren't slicing quite correctly. The base was easily fixed by going to 3x3, and the top wasn't too far wrong.

Also, it wasn't adhering very well. I tried various heat settings on the extruder, but couldn't make it work.

I was able to keep two of the supports at 100% infill, but they're too opaque and yellowish.
