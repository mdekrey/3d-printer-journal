I swapped in a new nozzle from Micro Swiss for the left nozzle. This took quite a bit of effort to do while the PLA was in the nozzle; next time, I should unload it first.

I decided to level the nozzles, too. The levelling screw is behind the right extruder motor, which meant I needed to unload that one, too. Also... it turns out that I've been unloading the entire time, which led to the issue with the jammed nozzles over a week ago. Allowing the motors to do their job instead of using the thumb lever is the way to go - it melts the plastic already in the machine, and feeds the rest out, resulting in a smooth end to the spool.

It's also important to clean the nozzle before levelling the bed. And it's important to remove the extruder motor AFTER starting to level the bed if levelling the nozzles, too.

1. Remove filament from right nozzle.
2. While still hot, clean the right nozzle.
3. Preheat and clean the left nozzle.
4. Allow everything to cool.
5. Start levelling bed in control panel
6. Remove the right extruder
7. Adjust everything for the left nozzle
8. Adjust the right nozzle to feel like the left by using the small hex wrench on the screw just above the heat block and pushing up on the heat block or down on the heat block filament intake above the extruder mount
9. When it's all set, put it back together.
