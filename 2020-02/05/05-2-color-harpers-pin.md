# Results

As previous attempts, the white tends to be the tricky one. The white PLA was definitely oozing more. It might need to be a lower temperature to fix the oozing... but it also didn't fill as well or adhere as well. Maybe increased extrusion with decreased temperature? This requires more experimentation...
