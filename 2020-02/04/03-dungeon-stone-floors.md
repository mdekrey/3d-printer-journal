Model: OpenForge 2.0 stone, 2 inch window (https://github.com/devonjones/openforge-tutorials/blob/master/sets/basic.md)

Slicer: Simplify3d

Filament: Concrete Grey PLA from Hatchbox

Settings:
- 0.1mm resolution
- Mostly default for Flashforge Creator Pro, using PLA, except:
    - Extruder heat at 205C
    - 200% for first layer, 4 top/bottom layers, 2 perimeter shells
    - 30% infill
    - Random perimeter start points
    - Raft (because the grey concrete won't adhere properly otherwise, with tearing, etc.)
    - Support settings
        - Upper vertical separation layers: 3
        - Lower vertical separation layers: 3
        - Support Infill Angles: 45 and -45
        - Dense support 3 layers, 80%
        - Support infill: 15%
        - Extra Inflation Distance: 0.1mm
    - Other settings
        - 100% bridge speed (to try to get it to adhere less)

Note: I moved this to the bathroom to try a more stable table.

# Results

This worked well, but are still adhering too much to the raft...
