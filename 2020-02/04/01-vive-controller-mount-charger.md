# Results

This turned out pretty incredibly. The banding is a little visible, but not regular... but it fit perfectly within the wall mount. So tight, in fact, that it's tough to get it back out!

Be sure to position the USB in this base _first_ and then insert it - it's difficult to adjust afterwards!
