# Print

Model: OpenForge dungeon stone square pillar (short) (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4077485)

Slicer: Simplify3d

Filament: White PLA from FlashForge

Settings:
- 0.2mm resolution
- Mostly default for Flashforge Creator Pro, using PLA, except:
    - Extruder heat at 205C
    - 200% for first layer, 4 top/bottom layers, 2 perimeter shells
    - 20% infill
    - Random perimeter start points
    - Raft (because the grey concrete won't adhere properly otherwise, with tearing, etc.)
    - No supports
    - Other settings
        - 100% bridge speed (to try to get it to adhere less)

# Results

White was an accident (it was supposed to be grey), but this turned out mostly well. The print curled upwards away from the bed, so I'm not quite sure what to do there again... maybe the extra heat caused it?
