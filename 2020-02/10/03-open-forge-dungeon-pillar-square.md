Model: OpenForge dungeon stone square pillar (short) (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4077485)

Slicer: Simplify3d

Filament: Concrete Grey PLA from Hatchbox

Settings:
- 0.2mm resolution
- Mostly default for Flashforge Creator Pro, using PLA, except:
    - Extruder heat at 205C
    - 200% for first layer, 4 top/bottom layers, 2 perimeter shells
    - 20% infill
    - Random perimeter start points
    - Raft (because the grey concrete won't adhere properly otherwise, with tearing, etc.)
    - No supports
    - Other settings
        - 100% bridge speed (to try to get it to adhere less)

# Results

This turned out well. Casey commented that the horizontal lines were more visible this way, but it was still fine.
