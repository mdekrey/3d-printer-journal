Model: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2766744
    - used OpenSCAD to make a 3x3 base (2 of them)
    - 2 2x2 tops, inverted

Slicer: Simplify3d

Filament: Transparent PLA from Gizmo Dorks

Settings:
- 0.2mm resolution
- Mostly default for Flashforge Creator Pro, using PLA, except:
    - 0.95 extrusion
    - Extruder heat at 200C
    - Bed heat at 60C
    - 100% for first layer, 4 top/bottom layers, 2 perimeter shells
    - 10% infill
    - Optimize perimeter start points
    - No skirt, raft, no supports

# Notes:

I did several of these - same settings, but the models were each printed separately.

# Results:

I still had the problem with the top, but it only resulted in one half of one square being sliced strangely. The bases worked well.

The full structure is a little more wobbly than I would like, but it works well enough for the game session!
