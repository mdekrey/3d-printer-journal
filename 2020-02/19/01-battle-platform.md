Settings:
- 0.2mm resolution
- Mostly default for Flashforge Creator Pro, using PLA, except:
    - 0.95 extrusion
    - Extruder heat at 200C
    - Bed heat at 50C
    - 200% for first layer, 4 top/bottom layers, 2 perimeter shells
    - 10% infill
    - Optimize perimeter start points
    - No skirt, raft, no supports

# Results:

These turned out much better. The infill is still obvious, but it works!
