# Print

Model: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3505006

Slicer: Simplify3d

Filament: Black PLA from Hatchbox

Settings:
- 0.1mm resolution
- Mostly default for Flashforge Creator Pro, using PLA, except:
    - Extruder heat at 200C
    - 100% for first layer, 8 top/bottom layers, 3 perimeter shells (As seen on [Fat Dragon Games' mini tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=716&v=AqEWl51s9Rw&feature=emb_logo))
    - 20% infill
    - Random perimeter start points
    - No supports
    - Skirt, no raft

Note: if this turns out well, I'll want to do https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3845304 in blue
