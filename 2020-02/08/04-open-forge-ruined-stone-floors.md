# Results:

Some of the bottoms of some of the floors were warped (didn't adhere well), so I think my print bed may be wearing out, or maybe I removed it while the print bed was still too warm and I warped it myself.

The walls had some extra filament from I don't know where.  The problem appeared much higher up than the ones that appeared to warp upwards, though, so I don't think that's it.
