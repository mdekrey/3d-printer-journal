    - Extruder heat at 200C
    - 100% for first layer, 4 top/bottom layers, 3 perimeter shells (As seen on [Fat Dragon Games' mini tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=716&v=AqEWl51s9Rw&feature=emb_logo))

    - No supports

# Results:

Since 0.2mm worked well for the walls, I tried it with the floors, but that was a bad idea. The texture loss on the top was a bad choice.

However, the bases look great as 0.2mm - almost indistinguishable from the previous bases.
