- Mostly default for Flashforge Creator Pro, using PLA, except:
    - Extruder heat at 200C
    - 100% for first layer, 4 top/bottom layers, 3 perimeter shells (As seen on [Fat Dragon Games' mini tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=716&v=AqEWl51s9Rw&feature=emb_logo))
    - 20% infill
    - No supports
    - Skirt, no raft

# Results:

This accidentally was the same settings as the lizard... and turned out better as a result. The walls are smoother, and the print was faster. I think I'm going to try more like this!
