# Print

Model: https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-tauriels-daggers-from-the-hobbit-4041, everything but Handle-BackUpperLower

Slicer: Simplify3d

Filament: Black PLA from Hatchbox

Settings:
- 0.2mm resolution
- Mostly default for Flashforge Creator Pro, using PLA, except:
    - Extruder heat at 200C
    - Bed heat at 50C
    - 100% for first layer, 8 top/bottom layers, 3 perimeter shells
    - 15% infill
    - Random perimeter start points
    - No skirt, raft, no supports

# Results

I followed the instructions on this more closely than intended - I wanted to do 0.1mm resolution, but I loaded an old print's settings and didn't notice. I changed the program using the printer's settings to fix the bed heat, at least, before starting.
