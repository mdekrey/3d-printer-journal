# Results

I followed the instructions on this more closely than intended - I wanted to do 0.1mm resolution, but I loaded an old print's settings and didn't notice. Again, the bed was at 60C, which is a mistake.

This, however, turned out beautifully nonetheless. Given some sanding and paint, this would make for an excellent prop.
