Today I finished the Mitre Angle Guage for my dad's table saw. It turned out great!

SCAD files are included in this folder.

The small piece was a test for the hardware and the mitre slot in the saw itself to ensure a tight fit. We used the hardware (screws, bolts, etc.) from the previous gauge he had as well as other bits he had around his garage - everything in the files is variable to better match another tablesaw or printer.

The only minor issue is that the front left of the printer bed didn't adhere well to the full guide, which curled a bit as a result, but didn't affect the shape of the fence or anything else critical.

The intensity and complexity of the project made me feel like putting 3d printing on hold for a little while, and I'm pretty low on filament anyway.
