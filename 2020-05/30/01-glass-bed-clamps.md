# Results

In order to get successful results, I did the following process:

1. Cleaned the bed.
2. Dried with blow drier.
3. Applied fresh glue-stick to the area the print would happen
4. Clamped to the print surface using the binder clips.

These turned out great. Due to the way the print appears to be designed, I can't use all 4 at once, so I have 2 in reserve for when the others wear out (or if it gets in the way of the other nozzle.)
