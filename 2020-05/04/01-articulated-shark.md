# Results

This came completely detached from the print bed after a few layers... and I didn't notice for an hour because I was working. This caused the nozzle to clog, and a large mess to occur. (Removed nozzle, soak in acetone...)

I will have to find a solution to the adhesion problem before continuing without supervision.
