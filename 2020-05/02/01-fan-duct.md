# Results

Minor issues - got a bit of elephant's foot with the lower layers such that the logo was completely smooth with the glass bed. Also, a bit of the PLA from the previous print must have been left in the extruder - a few layers into the print had some hiccups that look like other plastic was in the line.

Waited to let it cool to 60C and then went to remove it - a slight bump with my finger detached it from the glass. This makes printing with ABS _much_ easier than I could have anticipated!
