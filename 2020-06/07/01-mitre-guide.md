# Results


In order to get successful results, I did the following process:

1. Cleaned the bed.
2. Dried with blow drier.
3. Levelled the print bed with the glass in place
4. Applied fresh glue-stick to the full print bed
5. Replaced the glass and preheated
6. Tightened the thumb screws
7. Began the print.

This had minor pillowing at the top - I'm unsure how I had only 3 top/bottom layers, but that's apparent in the gcode. When I do the protractor, it will have 5 layers.
