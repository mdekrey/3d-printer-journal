    - Extruder heat at 205C
    - 0.1mm layer height, 200% for first layer, 8 top/bottom layers, 3 perimeter shells (As seen on [Fat Dragon Games' mini tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=716&v=AqEWl51s9Rw&feature=emb_logo))
    - 30% infill
    - Random perimeter start points

# Results

The skirt and raft extruded as normal. I think the issues are fixed!

This turned out well!
