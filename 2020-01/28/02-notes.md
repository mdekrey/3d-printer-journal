Because the left nozzle jammed (same as before!) and I could see plastic buildup on the outside, I knew it was PLA buildup. Since that [doesn't disolve in acetone like Saturday's jam](../26/notes.md), I needed to heat it up. I took it over to my dad's, who had a propane blowtorch and several other tools.

We put it on a piece of spare granite countertop and torched it. The outside became _white_, which made us nervous... but we kept going, then moved it with some pliers. We noticed plastic had definitely poured out and onto the granite piece. As it cooled, we began brushing it with a wire brush... this took the white off, as we discovered it was just ash. (This is why the acetone bath first is in the instructions!) The wires of the brush could fit through the nozzle, so we made sure it was clear. We used tiny strips of cloth to clean out the inside - it was sooty as well.

Taking it back home, I reassembled it (slightly misthreading it accidentally!) but somehow the filament pulled out without resistance from the top. I replaced the filament, then did "Load filament" and to do a manual feed. It didn't work...

I removed the heat sink and fan to see the feed motor - the feeding gear was jammed with plastic due to all of the grinding and not feeding the filament. I lightly cleaned it with a cotton swap and reassembled. This time it worked - though the filament came through dirty at first, it cleaned up after a bit!
