# Print

Model: OpenForge 2.0 stone, two 2x2 corners (https://github.com/devonjones/openforge-tutorials/blob/master/sets/basic.md)

Slicer: Simplify3d

Filament: Concrete Grey PLA from Hatchbox

Settings:
- 0.1mm resolution
- Mostly default for Flashforge Creator Pro, using PLA, except:
    - Extrusion multiplier at 0.95
    - Extruder heat at 205C
    - 0.1mm layer height, 200% for first layer, 8 top/bottom layers, 3 perimeter shells (As seen on [Fat Dragon Games' mini tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=716&v=AqEWl51s9Rw&feature=emb_logo))
    - 30% infill
    - Random perimeter start points
    - No supports needed
    - Raft

# Results

The skirt didn't look like it adhered quite as well, and the raft looks a little jumbled as a result. It was worked out by the top of the raft, so I'm not concerned about the print.
