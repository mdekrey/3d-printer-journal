    - Wooden: narrow, wide, 2x double
    - Metal (standard): narrow, wide, 2x double

Slicer: Simplify3d

    - Extruder heat at 200C
    - 0.1mm layer height, 200% for first layer, 8 top/bottom layers, 3 perimeter shells (As seen on [Fat Dragon Games' mini tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=716&v=AqEWl51s9Rw&feature=emb_logo))
    - Random perimeter start points
    - No supports needed

# Results

The wide doors' hinge is open on the side, but that was expected from the slicer. I hope they work. One of the metal double doors fell over near the end of the print, ruining that one... but the rest were fine. I'll need to reprint that one.
