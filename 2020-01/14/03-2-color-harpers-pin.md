# Results

This didn't work out as expected. The dual extrusion wizard turned off the raft for [the small Harper's pin](./01-Tiny-2-color-harpers-pin.md) so I turned it back on... that was a mistake. The raft appears to have adhered to the token itself and can't be removed, though the ooze shield was removed quite easily. The stringing that I'd seen lightly before showed up much more noticable against the blue background disk for the token itself.
