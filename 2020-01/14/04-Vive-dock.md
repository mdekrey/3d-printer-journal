# Results

This turned out quite beautifully, though some of the arches failed. Interestingly, only the right-half of the back arch turned out poorly, while the left half is fine... looking at the GCode, it appears to have started at/near the corner for the failing portion and away from the overhang for the portion that succeeded. There's some minor discoloration at these overhangs, like it was burned. That sounds like something that can be tweaked.

Also, I should have looked closer at the design. There isn't really enough room for the strap and USB charger. I'll be using a dremel to add a few extra holes for it. However, it's good enough that I'm making another.
