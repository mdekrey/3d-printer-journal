# Print

Model: Custom, built from a Harper's logo in svg and OpenSCAD.
Slicer: Simplify3d
Filament: White PLA from Flashforge and Blue PLA from Flashforge

Settings:
- Medium resolution
- Mostly default for Flashforge Creator Pro, using PLA, except:
    - Extruder heat at 200C
    - White raft at 60C

# Results

The raft didn't adhere quite as badly as before... it actually didn't adhere hardly at all. Unfortunately, the blue cylinder didn't form correctly, either; it continued to fray.
