I spent most of the day dealing with a clogged nozzle due to the use of ABS last night and not immediately running PLA through the nozzle. A bit of ABS hardened within the nozzle, and the hot PLA was not warm enough to melt it to get flow going. As a result, I also jammed PLA between the heating block and the feed motor, started causing grinding in the motor, and ended up disassembling the entire enclosure.

I learned that while ABS disolves in acetone, PLA does not. After using ABS, it is crucial to clean the nozzle by soaking it in acetone for 15 minutes.
