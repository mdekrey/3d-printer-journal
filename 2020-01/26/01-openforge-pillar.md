# Results

This print turned out the same as the [white and blue pillars previously done on the left](../17/01-openforge-pillar.md), which is to say nearly perfectly. One spot is visible in along the pillar where the support touched the pillar itself, but using the same gcode that produced the pillowing before produced the same results as the better prints!

The new cooling fan has opened the way for two-color prints!
