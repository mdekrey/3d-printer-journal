# Results

Tweaking support settings definitely helped with the structure for the model... but the supports adhered a little too well. As a result, it will be too difficult to remove from this mini. I can't remove it without damaging it.

This was the first model that didn't auto-generate supports in the correct places - the entire outward sword had no supports by default.

Also, this mini printed too small for D&D.
