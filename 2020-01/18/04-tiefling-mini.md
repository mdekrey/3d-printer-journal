This worked much better, but comparing it against an actual mini, I realized that the head was too large... the original size was correct. The supports came off easier this time, but I still needed to use needlenose pliers. The biggest issue was that the arm didn't connect due to improper support there, causing the back arm to fall off at the elbow.

Also, the blades are way too tiny compared to other quality prints, such as those from Hero Forge. I'm concluding that this is simply a bad model.
