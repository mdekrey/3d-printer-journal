Model: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1798035

Slicer: Simplify3d

Filament: Black PLA from Hatchbox

Settings:
- 0.2mm resolution
- Mostly default for Flashforge Creator Pro, using PLA, except:
    - Extruder heat at 200C
    - 0.2mm layer height, 200% for first layer, 4 top/bottom layers, 2 perimeter shells (As seen on [Fat Dragon Games' mini tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=716&v=AqEWl51s9Rw&feature=emb_logo))
    - 20% infill
    - Random perimeter start points
    - Generate supports
    - Raft

Note: I moved this to the bathroom to try a more stable table.

# Results

This turned out the same as the rest - the supports didn't really support,
