    - Extrusion multiplier at 0.95
    - Extruder heat at 205C
    - 0.1mm layer height, 200% for first layer, 8 top/bottom layers, 3 perimeter shells (As seen on [Fat Dragon Games' mini tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=716&v=AqEWl51s9Rw&feature=emb_logo))
    - 30% infill
    - Random perimeter start points
    - No supports needed
    - Raft

# Results

This turned out very well. It seems after adjustment, the extra extrusion is what I needed.
