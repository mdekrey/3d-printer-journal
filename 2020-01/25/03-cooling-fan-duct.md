# Results

I forgot to put in the 100% infill, and I probably should have done more with the outer walls. Also, the ABS was rated 210-240, so I think it might have been a little hot.

This turned out pretty well, but there's a couple spots in the bridging that are slightly deformed and there is a tiny hole in one spot. This should still work well for the cooling fan, at least until I decide to do ABS again.

I also printed it on the concrete floor of my garage, and was struck by how smooth the entire print turned out. I need a more stable workbench.

Unfortunately, the raft was also stuck too well to the duct - while removing it, a further hole was opened.
