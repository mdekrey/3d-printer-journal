This turned out worse than the last one, but there were noticable defects that affected entire layers. One of the teeth from the model fell off, and two are deformed, but again, this mostly affected the underside. It's observable on the end of the axle where the layer issues are. I found someone else online who had similar issues (lost the link, sorry), so I assumed it's more to do with the model itself.
