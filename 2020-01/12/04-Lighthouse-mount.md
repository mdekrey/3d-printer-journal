# Results

This print out turned out really well. The supports worked, and the size fits the Vive lighthouses perfectly. There was some stringing with the filament, and some of the surfaces are a little thin, especially around the edges. Some of the supports didn't attach perfectly which caused some of the bottom sides of the arches to not form correctly (especially on angles). I can see some striping in the layers, too.

I believe this is due to running at 205C instead of 200, so the next is going to be at the new temperature.
