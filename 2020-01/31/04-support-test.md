Model: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2676295

Slicer: Simplify3d

Filament: Concrete Grey PLA from Hatchbox

Settings:
- 0.1mm resolution
- Mostly default for Flashforge Creator Pro, using PLA, except:
    - Extruder heat at 205C
    - 200% for first layer, 4 top/bottom layers, 2 perimeter shells
    - 30% infill
    - Random perimeter start points
    - Raft (because the grey concrete won't adhere properly otherwise, with tearing, etc.)
    - Support settings
        - Upper vertical separation layers: 0

Note: I moved this to the bathroom to try a more stable table.

# Results

I think the supports adhered better than the actual wall did...
