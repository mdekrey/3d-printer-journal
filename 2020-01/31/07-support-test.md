Model: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2676295

Slicer: Simplify3d

Filament: Grey concrete PLA from Hatchbox

Settings:
- 0.1mm resolution
- Mostly default for Flashforge Creator Pro, using PLA, except:
    - Extruder heat at 205C
    - 200% for first layer, 4 top/bottom layers, 2 perimeter shells (As seen on [Fat Dragon Games' mini tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=716&v=AqEWl51s9Rw&feature=emb_logo))
    - 20% infill
    - Random perimeter start points
    - Raft (because the grey concrete won't adhere properly otherwise, with tearing, etc.)
    - Support settings
        - Upper vertical separation layers: 3
        - Lower vertical separation layers: 3
        - Support Infill Angles: 45 and -45
        - Dense support 2 layers
        - Support infill: 20%
        - Extra Inflation Distance: 0.1mm
    - Other settings
        - 100% bridge speed (to try to get it to adhere less)

Note: I moved this to the bathroom to try a more stable table.

# Results

This turned out well, but the underside was not as smooth as the last. It looked like because the dense support wasn't as dense, it was able to drip down a bit more than intended.
