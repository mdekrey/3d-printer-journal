# Results

This actually worked, though the supports adhered to strongly to the model on the underside. This would be acceptable to complete collapse, though.

This also seems to have adhered to the sides, where there should have been a gap of 0.3mm. It peeled away cleanly, though.

I think the supports adhered better than the actual wall did, as I broke it when peeling it off...
