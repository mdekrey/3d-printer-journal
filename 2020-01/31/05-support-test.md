Model: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2676295

Slicer: Simplify3d

Filament: Grey concrete PLA from Hatchbox

Settings:
- 0.1mm resolution
- Mostly default for Flashforge Creator Pro, using PLA, except:
    - Extruder heat at 205C
    - 200% for first layer, 4 top/bottom layers, 2 perimeter shells (As seen on [Fat Dragon Games' mini tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=716&v=AqEWl51s9Rw&feature=emb_logo))
    - 20% infill
    - Random perimeter start points
    - Raft (because the grey concrete won't adhere properly otherwise, with tearing, etc.)
    - Support settings
        - Upper vertical separation layers: 0
        - Combine support every 3 layers
    - Other settings
        - 100% bridge speed (to try to get it to adhere less)

Note: I moved this to the bathroom to try a more stable table.

# Results

Not all of the supports formed correctly (didn't stick due to too far away from the previous layer), and the vertical wall definitely did not, as 2 of its 3 layers went too fast to form. I'm letting it print through to the end, though.

This didn't turn out very well. It still adhered too strongly to the surfaces (top especially) and ended up not working.
