# Print

Model: https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-openforge-pillar-62308
Slicer: Simplify3d
Filament: Blue PLA from Flashforge

Settings:
- 0.1mm resolution
- Mostly default for Flashforge Creator Pro, using PLA, except:
    - Extruder heat at 200C
    - 0.1mm layer height, 200% for first layer, 8 top/bottom layers, 3 perimeter shells (As seen on [Fat Dragon Games' mini tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=716&v=AqEWl51s9Rw&feature=emb_logo))
    - Random perimeter start points

Note: Same settings from [yesterday](../16/01-openforge-pillar.md) but using the left extruder.

# Results

This turned out perfectly, with the same strip to sand. This confirms that the right extruder is not getting the proper cooling.

The rightmost pillar is this one. Compare with the left one.
