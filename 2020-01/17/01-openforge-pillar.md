# Print

Model: https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-openforge-pillar-62308
Slicer: Simplify3d
Filament: White PLA from Flashforge

Settings:
- 0.1mm resolution
- Mostly default for Flashforge Creator Pro, using PLA, except:
    - Extruder heat at 200C
    - 0.1mm layer height, 200% for first layer, 8 top/bottom layers, 3 perimeter shells (As seen on [Fat Dragon Games' mini tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=716&v=AqEWl51s9Rw&feature=emb_logo))
    - Random perimeter start points

Note: Same settings from [yesterday](../16/01-openforge-pillar.md) but using the left extruder.

# Results

This turned out perfectly, with only one strip to sand, where it appears the supports adhered to the pillar. I need to try this again with the blue but the left extruder.

The center pillar is this one. Compare with the left from yesterday's.
